## Overview
A modern flight booking application built with Angular and NgRx for state management. It allows users to search for flights and view available options

## Functionalities / Usage of UI

This section describes the key functionalities and user interactions of the Flight Booking System UI:

1. **User Input: Origin and Destination**
   - The user is required to input the **origin** and **destination** of their flight. These fields are **mandatory**.
   - **Autocomplete** functionality is provided for both origin and destination inputs, allowing users to select from a list of suggestions while typing, making the search process faster and more efficient.

2. **Currency Selection**
   - The user selects the **currency** they wish to use for flight pricing via a dynamic combo box.
   - The list of available currencies is retrieved dynamically from the server. The system will automatically update the available currency options based on the response from the server.

3. **Trip Type Selection**
   - The user must choose between a **one-way** or **round trip** flight by selecting one of two **radio buttons**. This selection is **mandatory** for performing a search.

4. **IATA Code Auto Retrieval**
   - The system automatically retrieves the **IATA code** for the origin and destination airports based on the user's input. This is achieved by an external API that translates the userâ€™s location name into its corresponding IATA code, ensuring accurate flight search results.

5. **Search for Flights**
   - After the user has filled in the required fields, they can press the **Search** button to retrieve available flights based on the input conditions.
   - The search is performed using the specified origin, destination, currency, and trip type. The application sends the request to the backend, which returns a list of available flights for the user to view.

## Arquitecture Overview

The app follows a clean architecture approach, with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend** (Angular): Handles the user interface, interactions, and displays data.
- **NgRx**: Manages the application state, including flight search data and user preferences.
- **Backend API**: Exposes flight data and currency functionality. Additional external API's were also used.

The data flow follows the typical **NgRx** pattern:
- Actions are dispatched from components (e.g., when a user initiates a search).
- Reducers process the actions and update the state.
- Components subscribe to the state and update the UI accordingly (Single Web Application).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
